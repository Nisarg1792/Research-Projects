$this is a reserved variable name and can not be used for anything else. 
It specifically points you to the object your are currently working in. 
You have to use $this because you do not know what variable object will be assigned to.

$this->name refers to the current class's variable name
$this->$name refers to the class variable of whatever the value of $name is. 

$name = "name";
echo $this->$name; // echos the value of $this->name.

$name = "test";
echo $this->$name;  // echos the value of $this->test
